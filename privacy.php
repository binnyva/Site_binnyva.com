The following are the policies that are adopted by this site to protect the privacy of the visitors or members.<br /><br />

<ol>
	<li>If you had submitted your email anywhere, I will not give it to any other sites. This measure is to protect the person from spam or unwanted(junk) mail.
	<li>I don't have a secured link for data transfer because there is no transfer of sensitive data like Credit Card number etc. So I will not be asking for it.
	<li>If you have given a user name/password, it will not be given to others. Currently I don't have a security encryption, but I will add it in the near future. An encryption for this purpose is under construction.
