You prisoner of the gutter<br />
Condemned by every syllable you utter.<br />
<br />
By right you should be taken out and hung<br />
For the cold blooded murder of the english tongue.<br />
<br />
This is what the student population<br />
Calls an elementary education.<br />
<br />
Just hear them in a class room anywhere<br />
Dropping malayalam in between everywhere.<br />
<br />
Why didn't the Englishmen teach Indians how to speak <br />
This verbal class distinction by now should be antique.<br />
<br />
A person's way of speaking absolutely classifies him<br />
The movement he talks he makes other person despise him.<br />
<br />
Hearing people who speaks manglish is painful to my ears<br />
But if you continue this, the teaches will be close to tears.<br />
<br />
Their are even classes where english completely disappears<br />
Well, in Class Eleven, they haven't used it for years.<br />
 <br />
Arab's learn arabian with the speed of lighting <br />
Hebrewes learn it  backwards which is absolutely frightening.<br />
<br />
Why can't we study to speak english which makes you sick<br />
But I think it is more interesting than rap music.<br />
