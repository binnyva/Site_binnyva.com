<h1 align="center">Lyrics Database V 1A.1</h1>
<strong>Over the years this software has fallen into disrepair. I have not put the program for download due to this fact.</strong><br />

<p>Lyrics Database is an software is for viewing lyrics of Songs.
This software is made for the purpose of working with winamp, but
<strong>not</strong> as a plugin. It takes advantage of a very little used
feature call <font color="#ff8019"><strong>Minibrowser</strong></font>. But
this software can also be used by itself as well. Just open the
file ;Index.html; in the lyrics folder in any browser.<br />
It is a huge collection of lyrics which you can use. <br />
