Many people helped me create this software. I would not even get over the treshold of collecting the lyrics if it was not for
these people.<br />

My brother, Bijoy, helped me much as he did many formatting works. He also shared his ideas with me.<br />
Arun, my classmate, showed great generocity in shareing his collection of lyrics with me. They make at least half of my software. He also gave me the idea of using small fonts.<br />
The website, <a href="http://www.lyrics.com">www.lyrics.com</a>, helped much. I got many lyrics from there</p>
