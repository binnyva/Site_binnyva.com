# Currently Working On...

### MindOS

My biggest personal project is MindOS - creating a Mental Operating System. This is a long project - my current estimate is around 10 years. But I have a principle of learning in public - so I have a running log of all things I learned as I try to build it available as a newsletter at [MindOS.in](https://mindos.in/). If a newsletter is too much reading for you, try the [twitter](https://twitter.com/inmindos) or [instagram](https://instagram.com/inmindos) channels.

### Zettelkasten, Digital Garden

I've discovered Zettelkasten Note Taking technique/Personal Knowledge Management system in mid 2020. I've fallen in love with it since then.

* **Theory**: I'm trying to make it more approachable to others - to that end, I made an [Interactive Introduction to Zettelkasten](https://binnyva.com/zettelkasten/).
* **Practice**: I've been taking notes in the Zettelkasten format for almost a year now. I'm publishing all of it at [Digital Zen Garden](https://notes.binnyva.com/)
* **Tools**: I have created tools that aid in the Zettelkasten process - the main one being [Gatsby Garden](https://github.com/binnyva/gatsby-garden)

### Make A Difference

I was the CTO of [Make A Difference](https://makeadiff.in/), an NGO working with Children in Need of Care and Protection until Sept 2022.

Most of the tech I make for MAD is Open Source and available at our [GitHub account](https://github.com/makeadiff).
