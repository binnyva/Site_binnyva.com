<h1 class="heading">I am a Pessimist</h1>

<center><table border=1><tr><td>
Two thousand spectators, two umpires,<br>
Fifty security personals, twenty two players,<br>
Still, even when facing such choice,<br>
The pigeon chose me as its target.<br>
<br>
Why me?<br>
"To be or not to be.<br>
That is the question." T'is said.<br>
Not so. Why me? That, is the question.<br>
<br>
Any person, irrespective of time and place,<br>
Would judge me as a pessimist without grace.<br>
"The worst pest is a Pessimist."<br>
They would exhort.<br>
<br>
Those people, those optimists, <br>
as they styled themselves.<br>
They mock me day in and day out.<br>
They do not know what the truth is.<br>
<br>
But you, O reader, don't fall in this trap.<br>
The real reasons must be within your grasp.<br>
For optimism, that stupid emotion, is a feeling,<br>
That one has before he has all the facts.<br>
<br>
Do not think even for the briefest second<br>
That for you, being a pessimist is not destined.<br>
Indeed, every single one of us has pessimist blood.<br>
Else why do we look for vehicles before crossing the road?<br>
<br>
A pessimist is always in good company.<br>
With us stands great people like Murphy,<br>
Who verbalized the gnome, now called Murphy's Law.<br>
"If anything can go wrong, It will."<br>
<br>
But aspiring to be like Murphy would be a lacking,<br>
a lacking in ambition beyond reasoning.<br>
When compared to the greatest of us,<br>
Murphy, bless his name, was an optimist.<br>
<br>
His law is out dated for some years,<br>
For to another law we are now all ears.<br>
This is our new law, a more accurate one.<br>
"If anything can't go wrong, it will find a way to."<br>

NOTE: I, Binny V A, did <b>not</b> write this poem to express my feelings. I wrote this
poem to make fun of my father and my brother, who are the greatest pessimist 
known to me. As for me, I AM A DIE-HARD OPTIMIST.
