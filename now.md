### Zettelkasten, Digital Garden

<a href="https://notes.binnyva.com/"><img src="/static/images/now/zettelkasten.png" alt="Zettelkasten Note Link Map" class="project-pic" /></a>

I've discovered Zettelkasten Note Taking technique/Personal Knowledge Management system in mid 2020. I've fallen in love with it since then.

- **Theory**: I'm trying to make it more approachable to others - to that end, I've taken a couple of sessions on [Zettelkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUCEZaxlFNI).
- **Practice**: I've been taking notes in the Zettelkasten format for almost a year now. I'm publishing all of it at [Digital Zen Garden](https://notes.binnyva.com/)
- **Tools**: I have created tools that aid in the Zettelkasten process - the main one being [Gatsby Garden](https://github.com/binnyva/gatsby-garden)

### Standup Philosophy

I am trying to become a stand-up philosopher. That means I talk about philosophy for the sake of entertainment rather than enlightenment. But if you get slightly enlightened as a result, I would consider that a happy side effect. 

To do this, I'm learning philosophy - and right now, I'm working through **[Existentialism](https://notes.binnyva.com/tags/existentialism)**. I publish this content on my [Standup Philosophy Site](https://standup-philosophy.netlify.app/).

### Make A Difference

I'm the Director of Technology at [Make A Difference](https://makeadiff.in/), an NGO working with Children in Need of Care and Protection.

Most of the tech I make for MAD is Open Source and available at our [GitHub account](https://github.com/makeadiff).
