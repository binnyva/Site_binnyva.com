<p>Even though I have seen his battered and bandaged face many times in the papers, I never thought that I would be the person who would perform the operation to make it well again. I was contacted at nine thirty today by Mr. Dushrali, the director of my hospital, congratulating me as I am the chief surgeon for the plastic surgery team for the boy. Even though I almost never read the papers, I have caught his bandaged face on the newspaper when my wife was reading it. It was the biggest propaganda coup for all the anti-American politicians and journalists. His story was a popular one even here in Kuwait even though most of us have a very pro-American stand in this war. I knew his name better than his face because of two reasons. Firstly, I have never seen his face. I have seen only the bandages that covered in the newspapers. Secondly, my nephew has the same name-Ali Khan. My nephew, Ali, lived on the border with my sister and her husbands family.</p>

<p>He was my favorite nephew. Even though I saw him three years ago, I remember him very well. He was very energetic, very buoyant and a very clever little lad. He must be nine years by now, I thought.</p>

<p>I was to meet the boy at 4:30 at the military hospital in Kuwait where I work. Then we will decide on the procedure of the operation and the extend of plastic surgery he will require. All in all, I would be with him for more than a week, I mused.</p>

<p>"So Rushdie, I hear that you are the chief surgeon for the Hali" Dr. Mohammad said as he entered my room.<br />
"Who is Hali?" I asked.<br />
"The kid you're operating on. That is the name by which he goes here - Handless Ali. Poor kid. He is only nine years old and he lost his entire family in this war, not to mention his hands."<br />
"When is he arriving?"<br />
"He arrived here yesterday. They transfered him to here to undergo the required surgery before they will take him back to another hospital. I was asked to give you the details of this case." Mohammad said as he handed over a yellow file to me "It contains the personal details and injury report for this case."<br /></p>

<p>I turned over to the first page.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Name: Ali Khan<br />
Father's Name : Ibrahim Khan<br />
Mother's Name : Rizwana Khan</strong></blockquote>

<p><em>His mother...</em></p>

<p>I suddenly stood up.</p>

<p>"Where is He?" I asked.<br />
"He is room B12."</p>

<p>I ran out of my office, pushing aside a very surprised Mohammad and got into the lift. As the lift slowed down to a stop, I got out of it and went in the room with the plate B12 on the top of the door.</p>

<p>As I walked in the boy in the bed, Ali, looked at me for the longest second of my life. Then his face broke into a smile.</p>

<p>"Uncle Rushdie!" He exclaimed.</p>
