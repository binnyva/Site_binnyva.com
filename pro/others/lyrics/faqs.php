Q. What is the advantage of this software over lyrics plugins?<br />
A. 1)This software has a large collection of lyrics at your disposal. The plugins require you to have the lyrics.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) It takes a long time to give each song its own lyrics. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) You can see only the lyrics of the song you are currently hearing using a plugin. With the Lyrics Database you can see the lyrics of any song of your choice.<br />
